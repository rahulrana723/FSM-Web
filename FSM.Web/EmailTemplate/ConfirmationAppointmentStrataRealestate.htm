<p>Hi {{ClientName}} ,</p>
<p>
    Please be advised that we will be servicing your roof and guttering on {{DateBooked}}, weather permitting, or soon thereafter.
    If you wish, you may advise the occupants of our visit, and remind them to:
</p>
<p>
<p>&bull; Keep all windows and doors closed </p>
<p> &bull; Allow access to rear courtyards/gardens (if applicable) for clean-up </p>
<p> &bull; Ensure no clean washing is left outdoors</p>
<p>&bull; Avoid leaving vehicles where they may be in the way of ladders used to access the building
    or be in a position where they may get dirty from debris as it is removed from the gutters</p>
<p> &bull; Do you need to be home? No, we
    can carry out all work without anyone home. We could gladly visit your property when you are at home if that is your preference.</p>
<p>
    Thank you for your time.
</p>

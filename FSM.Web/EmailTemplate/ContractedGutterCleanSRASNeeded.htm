<p>Hi</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please see the attached quote for a Safe Roof Access System that is required before we can conduct any further gutter cleans or work at the property. I have attached some further information regarding the importance of these systems for your reference.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can you please advise if the SRAS quote is accepted and we can then book this in with the (time frame) monthly gutter clean that is due again in (month due). The contract will remain on hold until a response is received.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any further queries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Sam Inston</p>

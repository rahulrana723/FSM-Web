<p>Hi</p>
<p>
    We currently have this property on a (time period) contract. At the last clean, the amount of the debris accumulated and the time
    taken to complete the job has increased. Due to this we have increased the contracted price to ($__) per clean.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can you please advise us if this price is accepted? The contract will remain on hold until we receive confirmation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please let us know if you require any further information.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Sam Inston</p>
